We are a small and efficient engineering consulting firm dedicated to providing high quality professional services. Founded in 2005, our journey began servicing clients in need for technical solutions, which over the years transitioned to engineering consulting services. With over a decade providing services in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area we strive to become your most knowledgeable and reliable partner for your construction projects, proficient and always aware of the latest trends in the industry.

Our business model is based on standard civil engineering practices. We start by understanding the specific needs of your project to then be able to propose the most suitable set of solutions. We provide a wide range of services that include entitlement support, feasibility studies, permitting, topographic surveys, grading and drainage plans, design of utility systems, construction administration services on civil scope, septic system design, cost estimating services, hydrology and hydraulic design, winterization and erosion control plans, SWPPP report preparation, green design practices, and general civil consultation.

Our project experience throughout California has provided us exposure to different markets. This exposure has enabled us to understand the approving process for different cities, towns and counties, which in turn translates into delivering low cost services, on time, and within budget.

We understand the role of a consultant, therefore we understand the importance of keeping our clients constantly informed throughout the design, and construction phase of all projects. If you work with us once, you will understand why our best marketing tool has been our client referrals.
