Founded in 2005, our journey began servicing clients in need for technical solutions, which over the years transitioned to engineering consulting services. With over a decade providing services in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area we strive to become your most knowledgeable and reliable partner for your construction projects, proficient and always aware of the latest trends in the industry.\n\nOur business model is based on standard civil engineering practices. We start by understanding the specific needs of your project to then be able to propose the most suitable set of solutions. We provide a wide range of services that include entitlement support, feasibility studies, permitting, topographic surveys, grading and drainage plans, design of utility systems, construction administration services on civil scope, septic system design, cost estimating services, hydrology and hydraulic design, winterization and erosion control plans, SWPPP report preparation, green design practices, and general civil consultation.\n\nOur project experience throughout California has provided us exposure to different markets. This exposure has enabled us to understand the approving process for different cities, towns and counties, which in turn translates into delivering low cost services, on time, and within budget.\n\nWe understand the role of a consultant, therefore we understand the importance of keeping our clients constantly informed throughout the design, and construction phase of all projects.

IUCN, UNEP, WWF.\n\nWe stand out from other firms by providing cost-efficient sustainable practices combining integrity, aesthetics and mindfulness for the project’s budget, schedule, and efficient construction procedures.\n\nThe term “Sustainability” as applied to Construction and Engineering projects, is directly related to the implementation of environmentally responsible practices. In our professional opinion, it is crucial for development projects to be designed with the intent to satisfy today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their own needs. Finding a good balance between the cost of applying sustainable alternatives, and the ability to stay within the project’s budget is exactly where we strive.\n",

The role of the Civil Engineering consultant is to guide the owner, developer and/or team of consultants through the process of selecting alternatives to better suit the property. Grading Plans are required by public agencies in order to ensure consistency with the municipality’s grading and stormwater ordinance as well as to closely monitor earth-moving operations so that problems can be prevented.\n\nEvery project is unique; the shape of the land, the character of the area, the existing natural features, etc. Throughout the plan approval process, most municipalities pay close attention to the neighborhood character. It is important that the applicant, the civil engineer, and the approving agency have a common understanding about the key features of neighborhood character so that the residential development proposal respects the existing or preferred neighborhood character and satisfies all the requirements of the residential development provisions in planning schemes.\n\n> The key to understanding character is being able to describe how the features of an area come together to give that area its own particular character. Breaking up character into discrete features and characteristics misses out on the relationships between these features and characteristics. Understanding how these relationships physically appear on the ground is usually the most important aspect in establishing the character of the area.\n\nJust like other consultants in the project, civil engineers should be selected based on their strengths in design and based on matching those strengths to the specific project needs. With regards to budgeting, special attention should be required to the engineer’s track record of keeping projects within budget as well as being able to meet deadlines. Upon an analysis of the above, the selected consultant should be able to maintain a high level of professionalism in pursuit of solutions that adapt to the project’s budget, yet keeping a strong connection with the aesthetic component that should always come from precise grading.\n",
